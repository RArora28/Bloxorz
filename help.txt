The game is about moving a block from its initial position to its goal state which is a hole of unit length.

Now the block hasa three orientations :-
	1. Vertical
	2. Along Y axis
	3. Along Z axis

Assuming our board is on the x-y plane, we could be saying that either the block is standing (in case 1) or lying down (in case 2 and 3).
This property is useful in defining several interesting features of the game :-

	1. Fragile Tiles : These tiles break if our block stands vertically at this cell/tile. So, one can only pass throug these tiles if in an lying down position.
	2 Switch : These are the switches that are activated if the block stands on them
	
Now, switches are special tiles that brings out/in the bridge tiles. So only if you activate a switch does a special bridge is visible that allows you to reach the destination.

I have also provided the facility of viewing our game through different perspectives :-
	You can view different views by toggling using Space Bar.
